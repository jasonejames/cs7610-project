# CS 7610 Project: Penguin Maze

## About


Project for a computer graphics course in Spring 2020. I implemented the Aldous-Broder algorithm for generating a maze and created a 3D game to guide a penguin through the maze. For the game environment, I tried to go with an island theme. The game is programmed written in C / C++ / Objective-C using OpenGL for the graphics and Cocoa for the GUI.
